# Requirements

The requirements emntioned below needs to be addressed before our Bot can work, lets try to figure out whether you have all the requirements fulfilled or not.

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git or an equivalent SCM tool installed.

> [!TIP] 
> **Not sure whether you have python?** Perform the following steps.

```
py --version
```
 or

```
python --version
```

 Should return a response like:

```
Python 3.11.4
```

> [!TIP] 
> **Checking out whether Git is installed on your device** Perform the following steps.

In your command line upon running the command `git` should return a simillar result:
```
usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>] <command> [<args>]
```
This means `git` is correctly installed on your device.

# Usage

### Running the bot

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to mark attendance for the previous month:
   
    ```bash

    py -m Attendbot.mark -m<Month In Number>
    ```
    **example:**
    ```bash
    py -m Attendbot.mark -m8
    ```
This should tell the bot that you want it to mark your shift claim for the Month of August.
By default if you were to not mention any month, the Bot try to mark the attendence for the previous month.

### Interactive Mode

To run the Bot in interactive mode (displaying the browser window), use the `-i` flag:

```bash

py -m Attendbot.mark -i -m8
```


### Specifying Month
To specify the month for which attendance needs to be applied, use the -m flag followed by the month value (integer):
```

py -m Attendbot.mark -m6


```

Alternatively,

```

py -m Attendbot.mark -m 6


```

This command will mark attendance for June.

Or, you can use both the flags in conjunction:

```

py -m Attendbot.mark -m 6 -i

```

This will run the bot in Interactive mode and tell it to mark attendence for the month of June.
